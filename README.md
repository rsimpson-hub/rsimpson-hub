- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert
- Last year, I started my career transition from Supply Chain / purchasing professional to Developer. I'm currently employed as an Developer Analyst working 
on an IFS Field Service Management implementation. I started learning to program with Python in my spare time, thanks to Runestone academy's free courses 
about 2 years ago and have been involved ever since. In the past year, I've transitioned over to learning the .NET ecosystem.

Right now, I'm using this profile to store projects I'm working on or completed on my path to becoming a developer.


- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full fledged .NET Developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, SQL Server, ASP.NET, Blazor (Server & wasm), PowerShell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that could help me become a better developer.
- 📫 How to reach me: RobSimpson1@gmail.com
