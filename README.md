- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert
In 2021, I transitioned from a career in supply chain and finance to software engineering. I currently work as a backend developer building interfaces between JD Edwards E1 and IFS Field Service Management. I also maintain and configure Field Service Management and automate functions with C# dotNET. Most of my work is done using T-SQL, .NET, ASP.NET, PowerShell and SSIS.



- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full fledged .NET Developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ASP.NET, Blazor (Server & wasm).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that could help me become a better developer.
- 📫 How to reach me: RobSimpson1@gmail.com
